Musicope is an open-source online piano game similar to [Synthesia](http://synthesiagame.com/) or [PianoCrumbs](http://www.pianocrumbs.com/piano/). 

You can download a Windows version under the release section. After the first run, a folder is created under `documents` called `Musicope`. You can add your own songs in the `songs` subfolder.
