Musicope is an open-source online piano game similar to [Synthesia](http://synthesiagame.com/) or [PianoCrumbs](http://www.pianocrumbs.com/piano/). 

You can download a Windows version under the release section. After the first run of the game, this folder is created if it does not exist: `c:\Users\{name}\Documents\Musicope\`. You can add your own songs in the `songs` subfolder.
