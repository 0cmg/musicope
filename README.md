# Introduction

Musicope is an open-source online piano game similar to [Synthesia][1] or [PianoCrumbs][2]. Notice, that you must have [Jazz plug-in][3] installed or Web Midi API enabled in order to be able to play the game! The game uses WebGL so please use a [web browser][4] that supports WebGL.

You can play the game [here][5]. It requires Dropbox login as it is where it takes the songs from and stores them. All the songs that you place in `Dropbox/Apps/Musicope/songs/` should show up in the game.
